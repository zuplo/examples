# Zuplo Mocking & Unit Test Sample

This sample shows how to mock `ZuploRequest` and `ZuploContext` in order to write unit tests. This sample uses [mocha](https://mochajs.org/) and [sinon](https://sinonjs.org/), but the concepts apply to any test and mocking tool.

See the [`handlers.spec.ts`](https://github.com/zuplo-samples/test-mocks/blob/main/unit-tests/handlers.spec.ts) file for details.
